## **APIs and Technology Stack**

### **Solana Blockchain**
The app leverages Solana's blockchain infrastructure for:
- **Transaction History**: Using the `getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2` RPC method.
- **Balances**: Using the `getTokenAccountsByOwner` method to fetch token balances.
- **Token Metadata**: Using `getAccountInfo` to retrieve additional details about tokens.

### **External APIs**
- **Coingecko API**: Provides real-time price data and market capitalization for SPL tokens on Solana.

### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: Built with Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design.
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana Wallet Adapter for connecting wallets like Phantom.

### **Backend**
- The app relies on Solana RPC endpoints for blockchain data and integrates with external APIs for token analytics.
- Optimized API calls ensure quick responses and reduced data fetch overhead.
